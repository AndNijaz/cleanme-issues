# CleanMe

## 1. Introduction

CleanMe is an app designed to make it easier for users to connect with professional cleaners. It allows for quick and simple booking of cleaning services. Users can browse available cleaners, filter them by location, price, and services offered, and easily schedule an appointment. Once a booking is made, all communication remains within the app to ensure transparency and security. In case of cancellations or rescheduling, the system automatically records changes, helping cleaners manage their time and availability more efficiently.

## 2. Features

CleanMe includes the following features:

- **User Registration** – Two types of users can register: cleaner and client.
- **Post-registration for Cleaners** – After basic registration, cleaners can enter their services, hourly rates, working hours, and additional details.
- **Login System** – Secure login for both cleaners and clients, with redirection to their respective dashboards.
- **Client Dashboard** – Clients can search for cleaners using filters such as price, availability, location, and service type.
- **Cleaner Dashboard** – Cleaners can view incoming bookings, accept or decline requests, and update their information.
- **Search and Filtering** – Clients can filter cleaners based on services, working hours, location, and price, with an option to sort by price.
- **Cleaner Profiles** – Each cleaner has a profile card displaying key details, services, pricing, and buttons for booking or saving.
- **Booking Appointments** – Clients can book services by selecting a time, location, and adding comments.
- **Booking Notifications** – Cleaners receive requests that they can accept or decline, while clients get updates on their booking status.
- **Live Chat** – Communication between clients and cleaners is enabled but only within three days of the scheduled service to prevent off-app arrangements.
- **Cancellation and Rescheduling** – Clients can cancel an appointment, except within the last three days before the scheduled service.
- **Rating System** – After the service is completed, clients can rate the cleaner's work.
- **User Protection** – Terms & Conditions, as well as cancellation and rescheduling policies, are in place to ensure a fair and reliable service.
- **TO BE IMPLEMENTED: Secure Payments** – Integrated online payment system within the app to ensure transaction security.
